This simple machine was first invented in 1817 by German Inventor Karl von Drais since then it has evolved a lot and used for variety of activities even in recent years. \n","\n","Some of the reasons why cycles are so special are as follows:\n","- Eco Friendly\n","- Easy to use\n","- Cheaper to buy\n","- Less maintenance\n","- Easy to place (compactness)\n","\n","And with developed in technologies new features like **geotracking** and **electric bicycles** has been developed. All these reasons have created renting cycles to the public a potential buisness opportunity. One such company is **Cyclistic** , a Chicago based company which provides rental services for cycles. **Cyclistic** provides both casual daily passes and annual membership to the customers. The main motivation of this EDA is to find various insights on the behaviour of the cyclists and come up with strategies to increase the cycle usage using the kaggle cyclistic dataset.\n","\n","**The following steps will be followed in the analysis :**\n","\n","- Downloading the [Cyclistic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunnarn/chicago-bicycle-rent-usage?select=202207-divvy-tripdata.csv) Dataset from Kaggle.\n","- Installing and Importing essential libraries for analysis\n","- Preprocessing and data cleaning\n","- Asking and Answering Questions \n","- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n","- Writing a conclusion"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_ib4uLE94jzm"},"source":["## **Downloding the cyclistic Dataset from Kaggle**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7294,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678753287453,"user":{"displayName":"suraj d","userId":"17992575853531789601"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"S3VI62KYL1QB"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Installing the opendatsets python library\n","!pip install opendatasets --quiet"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aTWymfHAOG70"},"source":["[opendatsets](https://pypi.org/project/opendatasets/#:~:text=opendatasets%20is%20a%20Python%20library,using%20a%20simple%20Python%20command.) is a python library used for downloading datasets from kaggle and google drive effortlessly"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":19,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678753287455,"user":{"displayName":"suraj d","userId":"17992575853531789601"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"3psCeYjRMxKp"},"outputs":[],"source":["import opendatasets as od\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":36048,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678753323486,"user":{"displayName":"suraj d","userId":"17992575853531789601"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"L16raYpoMH_T","outputId":"f90110aa-1769-45e0-d8b1-139fa3c3cde5"},"outputs":[],"source":["url='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunnarn/chicago-bicycle-rent-usage?select=202207-divvy-tripdata.csv'\n","od.download(url)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"szmExX8nNvC5"},"source":["All csv files has been downloaded from kaggle, for this analysis we will be using the latest data that is of July 2022."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":27,"status":"ok","timestamp":1678753323489,"user":{"displayName":"suraj d","userId":"17992575853531789601"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"n8ZC5rNtMuy_"},"outputs":[],"source":["file_path='./chicago-bicycle-rent-usage/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv'"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kD1UkR3SS594"},"source":["### **About the Data**\n","\n","The complete dataset consist of 28 .csv files ranging from April 2020 to July 2022.

Thus the standards of classic bikes should be increased for better customer satisfaction and **more usage**.\n","- The most popular start stations are `Streeter Dr & Grand Ave`, `DuSable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd`, `Michigan Ave & Oak St`. These station should always have extra bikes and other facilities such as cafeteria, park etc, to attract more customers. \n","- There are almost 89702 unique routes where the start and end locations are not same. `Streeter Dr & Grand Ave` station has the maximum connection when seen in the map. Thus this station should be well maintained and should provide good service to customers.\n","- Customers tend to use more of electric bikes when the distance is more than 15 km. Thus the electric bikes should be well tuned and maintained for handling long distances.\n","- Similarly customers also tend to use electric bikes to travel faster. Thus the mechanics and the motor should be well designed and should be capable to handle higher speed without wear and tear.\n","- Most of the membered customer travel only for short distances. With the increase in distance the number of membered customers is less. Thus some kind of offers and discounts should be introduced for the casual riders who travel long distances if they choose to take annual membership.\n","- The route `DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St --> Streeter Dr & Grand Ave` has more casual riders  when destination is different. Thus this route has to be well maintained.\n","- `Clark St & Elmdale Ave to Walden Pkwy & 100th St`, `Museum of Science and Industry to Benson Ave`, `Benson Ave & Church St to Lake Park Ave & 56t` are the top 3 longest routes used by the riders. Riders using these routes should be given discounts on annual membership.\n","\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Future Work**\n","\n","- All the start and end station should be categorized based on the streets and area they are in.\n","- Analysing  the usage of bikes by the riders with the previous year's data.\n","- Introducing new dataset like popular locations in `Chicago` for analysing why there are more traffic in certain area.\n","- Building a ML model to predict the usage of bikes in the future and which type of bike has more scope.
